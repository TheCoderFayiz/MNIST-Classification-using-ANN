# MNIST-Classification-using-ANN
Here, MNIST dataset is classified using ANN. More than 100 thousand parameters were requires to classify with an accuracy of 97% despite the image size being small 
and image object being centred which indicate need for Convolutional Neural Networks for classifying images.
